Input currently comes from sample_input.json. 
That file must be written so that ingredient names in menu items exactly match existing ingredients in the ingredients dictionary. 
Units must be identical between the instance of an ingredient in the bulk section and the and recipe section.

Example:

			"name": "ketchup",
			"bulk_total_price": 17.82,      (this is the total bulk order price in dollars)
			"bulk_size": 16,                (this is how many bottles in a bulk order, for instance)
			"bulk_individual_size": 14,     (this is the size of each bottle, in bulk_unit_measurement) (i.e. 14 oz)
			"bulk_unit_measurement": "oz"   (this is how it is measured. must be the same in the recipe section vvvvv)
      
      "name": "Cheeseburger",
			"asking_price": 10.00,
			"ingredients": [{
				{
					"name": "ketchup",          (must match the above name definition "ketchup" exactly)
					"quantity": 0.5             (this must be in ounces)
				}

Output is sent to output.json. The output currently looks like this:
